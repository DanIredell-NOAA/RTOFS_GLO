Minor change

DESCRIPTION OF CHANGE:  

Add Data Assimilation for RTOFS. This requires new observational inputs and 
DA processing brought from Navy (NCODA).

BENEFIT OF CHANGE: 

Currently RTOFS uses Navy RTOFS restart file and that will be unavailable in the near future.

RISKS:

IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------------

I.1)  Check out RTOFS_GLOBAL:
       git clone --single-branch -b RB-2.0.0 ssh://$LOGNAME@vlab.ncep.noaa.gov:29418/EMC_rtofs_glo_prod rtofs_glo.v2.0.0
       into /gpfs/dell1/nco/ops/nwprod/
       The result will be the directory rtofs_glo.v2.2.0

I.2)  Get the fix files
       mkdir fix
       cp -R /gpfs/dell2/emc/modeling/noscrub/emc.ncodapa/FIXFILES/v2.0.0/fix/ fix


II. COMPILE PROJECT SOURCE CODES
--------------------------------

# libraries
cd libs
./build_libs.sh

# source
cd sorc
./build_rtofs.sh clean
./build_rtofs.sh compile
./build_rtofs.sh install


III. SET-UP INITIAL CONDITIONS
------------------------------
It's important to start with the run that we have been running. A cold-start run will not
produce acceptable results. The run in emc.ncodapa has been running for over a year.

III.1) mkdir -p $COMROOT/rtofs/$envir
III.2) ln -s /gpfs/dell2/emc/modeling/noscrub/emc.ncodapa/COMDIR/com/rtofs/prod/rtofs.YYYYMMDD $COMROOT/rtofs/$envir  (for PDYm1)


IV. FAILURE RECOVERY
--------------------

Data Assimilation - if no observation data found, then the DA jobs will still create a restart file for the analysis.
If a DA job fails, then it should be rerun.

Forecast jobs write a restart file every 24 hours of forecast. They can be restarted from that point.

Post processing jobs should be retried upon failure. They will pick up where they left off.


V. RESTRICTED CODES
-------------------

The codes in sorc/rtofs_ncoda.fd are restricted and cannot be shared outside of NCEP.  
They also cannot be put on the rzdm server.
