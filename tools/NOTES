Some random notes on the RTOFS V2 port to hera.

1. There is no ice processing. The ssmi executable was not ported so that part
of the QC fails. It does not affect the rest of the QC.

2. Not all products are created because cdo is not available on hera. I believe
that cdo is used to create products for OPC only.

3. The NCODA codes are not part of the repo. The compiled binaries are part of
the repo.

4. The bufr_dumplist that was implemented on wcoss for RTOFS is not on hera. I
ported it myself and is in the directory under my name. The runtime module 
loads this module.

5. RTOFS makes heavy use of the WCOSS function CFP (Command File Processor).
which is like mpiserial. It is not on hera but I found a home-built one in
/scratch1/NCEPDEV/mdl/apps/modulefiles. This is probably an older version,
but it seems to work fine.

6. The observational data that resides in the monthly tanks is saved on disk
on WCOSS only. This data is bathy, tesac, xbtctd and subpfl. There is a note 
in the get_dcom_data.sh script that shows how to find and rename the data.

7. The launch script ncoda_rtofs_glo.launch.sh is an old script from WCOSS
that I modified for hera. There is probably some dead code in there and
some macros that are set that are no longer used. But it works.
