This section describes the use of the Attribute class.  There are six examples that follow, which outline the use of Attributes at three increasing levels of difficulty.  The first example covers basic Attribute manipulations on the gridded Component.  The second example covers the Attribute package capabilities, including Attribute package nesting and Attribute hierarchy linking.  The third example covers Attribute management in a distributed environment and the I/O utilities.  These examples will be best understood if followed in an ascending order from basic to advanced.  The last three examples cover setting of Attribute packages from an XML file.
